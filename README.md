## How it works ##
Step 1 - You install the plugin and visit a Pouet prod page. You get a new link:

Step 2: You click the link, and the demo starts downloading - the target path is generated from the demo's metadata, like party or group name.

Step 3: The downloaded demo is (optionally) extracted to it's own folder:

## Project plans ##

None. Feel free to offer your services to fix stuff or add new features because I won't. I spent all the time I wanted on it, and I'm not exactly a fan of Javascript OR XUL.

And no I won't port it for Chrome either, but if someone does, I'll be glad to share the space.

Enjoy!
